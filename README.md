# Graph Theory Project - G00366614 - Owen Kelly

## Introduction
For this Graph Theory project, a script file must be developed using the Python 3 programming language to search a text file using a regular expression. The program must take a regular expression and the name or path of the file as command line arguments and output the lines of the file matching the regular expression. 

This project must contain:
* A script.py file which contains the algorithm used to read a text file.
* A text file for the script to read. 
* A necessary README.md file describing the program, steps to run and test it, an explaination of the algorithm, and the answers to the following questions:
  * What is a regular expression?
  * How do regular expressions differ across implementations?
  * Can all formal languages be encoded as regular expressions?

Research has been conducted to understand the following:
* Understand and be able to code using the Python 3 programming language.
* Understand the term "regular expression" and how it can be applied to the project.
* Understand how to test the regular expression so that it works on a sensible example list of inputs
